You've successfully prepared Mergington High's extracurricular activities website for healthy and safe collaboration. Make sure you let the principal know so he can brag to the IT department about your proactive efforts!

Here is a snippet of something you can share:

- Protected our code from accidental mistakes with `.gitignore` and branch protections.
- Set clear guidelines for teacher contributions with `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODEOWNERS`.
- Established community standards with a Code of Conduct and structured issue templates.
- Prepared for the future security challenges by enabling automated scanning and providing safe submission procedures.
